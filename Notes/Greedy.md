What is greedy alogorithm?
=> Greedy algorithm is a way of solving problems where you:
=> Always pick the best option available at each step, hoping that is leads to the overall best solution.
=> Imagine you're hungry and walking through a buffet. A greedy approach is like picking the yummiest-looking dish every time you see one, without planning the whole meal in advance. Youâ€™re just making the best choice for the moment.

=> In Programming Terms:
You solve a problem step-by-step, and at each step:
You choose the locally best option (greedy choice)(the best option available at that step),
Without thinking about the bigger picture or future steps.

Pros: Simple,easy to implement,run fast
Cons:Very often they do not provide a globally optimum solution

When to use?
Problems on which greedy approach works has 2 properties:

Greedy choice property - A global optimum can be arrived at by selecting local optimum
Optimal substructure - An optimal solution to the problem contains and optimal solution to subproblems

Greedy algorightm never re-considers its choices. This is different from dynamic programming
